# FUNCTIONS
#
# Functions are usually characterized by the name of the function followed by 
# parentheses.
# The Sys.Date() function returns a string representing today's date.
Sys.Date()

# You're free to implement the function my_mean however you want, as long as it
# returns the average of all of the numbers in `my_vector`.
#
# Hint #1: sum() returns the sum of a vector.
# 	Ex: sum(c(1, 2, 3)) evaluates to 6
#
# Hint #2: length() returns the size of a vector.
# 	Ex: length(c(1, 2, 3)) evaluates to 3
#
# Hint #3: The mean of all the numbers in a vector is equal to the sum of all of
#		   the numbers in the vector divided by the size of the vector.
#
# Note for those of you feeling super clever: Please do not use the mean()
# function while writing this function. We're trying to teach you something 
# here!
#
# Be sure to save this script and type submit() in the console after you make 
# your changes.

my_mean <- function(x) {
        # Write your code here!
        # Remember: the last expression evaluated will be returned! 
        mean <- sum(x) / length(x)
        mean
}

my_mean(c(4, 5, 10))    ## Here the function is called

# You're going to write a function called "remainder." remainder() will take
# two arguments: "num" and "divisor" where "num" is divided by "divisor" and
# the remainder is returned. Imagine that you usually want to know the remainder
# when you divide by 2, so set the default value of "divisor" to 2. Please be
# sure that "num" is the first argument and "divisor" is the second argument.
#
# Hint #1: You can use the modulus operator %% to find the remainder.
#   Ex: 7 %% 4 evaluates to 3. 
#
# Remember to set appropriate default values! Be sure to save this 
# script and type submit() in the console after you write the function.

remainder <- function(num = 1, divisor = 2) {
        # Write your code here!
        # Remember: the last expression evaluated will be returned!
        rmd <- num %% divisor
        rmd
        
}


remainder(5)
remainder(divisor = 11, num = 5)

# you can use the args() function! to see a function's arguments
args(remainder)

# You can pass functions as arguments to other functions just like you can pass
# data to functions. Let's say you define the following functions:
#
# add_two_numbers <- function(num1, num2){
#    num1 + num2
# }
#
# multiply_two_numbers <- function(num1, num2){
#	num1 * num2
# }
#
# some_function <- function(func){
#    func(2, 4)
# }
#
# As you can see we use the argument name "func" like a function inside of 
# "some_function()." By passing functions as arguments 
# some_function(add_two_numbers) will evaluate to 6, while
# some_function(multiply_two_numbers) will evaluate to 8.
# 
# Finish the function definition below so that if a function is passed into the
# "func" argument and some data (like a vector) is passed into the dat argument
# the evaluate() function will return the result of dat being passed as an
# argument to func.
#
# Hints: This exercise is a little tricky so I'll provide a few example of how
# evaluate() should act:
#    1. evaluate(sum, c(2, 4, 6)) should evaluate to 12
#    2. evaluate(median, c(7, 40, 9)) should evaluate to 9
#    3. evaluate(floor, 11.1) should evaluate to 11

evaluate <- function(func, dat){
        # Write your code here!
        # Remember: the last expression evaluated will be returned!
        func(dat)
}

evaluate(sd, c(1.4, 3.6, 7.9, 8.8))     ## Here it was used the sd() function

# Try using evaluate() along with an anonymous function to return the first 
# element of the vector c(8, 4, 0)
evaluate(function(x){x[1]}, c(8, 4, 0))

# Now try using evaluate() along with an anonymous function to return the last 
# element of the vector c(8, 4, 0).
evaluate(function(x){x[length(x)]}, c(8, 4, 0))

# For the rest of the course we're going to use the paste() function frequently.
paste("Programming", "is", "fun!")

# Let's explore how to "unpack" arguments from an ellipses when you use the
# ellipses as an argument in a function. Below I have an example function that
# is supposed to add two explicitly named arguments called alpha and beta.
# 
# add_alpha_and_beta <- function(...){
#   # First we must capture the ellipsis inside of a list
#   # and then assign the list to a variable. Let's name this
#   # variable `args`.
#
#   args <- list(...)
#
#   # We're now going to assume that there are two named arguments within args
#   # with the names `alpha` and `beta.` We can extract named arguments from
#   # the args list by using the name of the argument and double brackets. The
#   # `args` variable is just a regular list after all!
#   
#   alpha <- args[["alpha"]]
#   beta  <- args[["beta"]]
#
#   # Then we return the sum of alpha and beta.
#
#   alpha + beta 
# }
#
# Have you ever played Mad Libs before? The function below will construct a
# sentence from parts of speech that you provide as arguments. We'll write most
# of the function, but you'll need to unpack the appropriate arguments from the
# ellipses.

mad_libs <- function(...){
        # Do your argument unpacking here!
        args <- list(...)
        place <- args[["place"]]
        adjective <- args[["adjective"]]
        noun <- args[["noun"]]
        # Don't modify any code below this comment.
        # Notice the variables you'll need to create in order for the code below to
        # be functional!
        paste("News from", place, "today where", adjective, "students took to the streets in protest of the new", noun, "being installed on campus.")
}

# The syntax for creating new binary operators in R is unlike anything else in
# R, but it allows you to define a new syntax for your function. I would only
# recommend making your own binary operator if you plan on using it often!
#
# User-defined binary operators have the following syntax:
#      %[whatever]% 
# where [whatever] represents any valid variable name.
# 
# Let's say I wanted to define a binary operator that multiplied two numbers and
# then added one to the product. An implementation of that operator is below:
#
# "%mult_add_one%" <- function(left, right){ # Notice the quotation marks!
#   left * right + 1
# }
#
# I could then use this binary operator like `4 %mult_add_one% 5` which would
# evaluate to 21.
#
# Write your own binary operator below from absolute scratch! Your binary
# operator must be called %p% so that the expression:
#
#       "Good" %p% "job!"
#
# will evaluate to: "Good job!"

"%p%" <- function(left, rigth){ # Remember to add arguments!
        paste(left, rigth)
        
}

"I" %p% "love" %p% "R!"
